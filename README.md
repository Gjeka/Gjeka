Hi there!

My name is Kristi Gjeka and I am a <b>Full Stack Web and Mobile Developer</b>. I am specialised in the use of React JS and React Native to deliver efficient and responsive front end implementations. I am also specialised in the use of the Django Framework to implement a robust back end.

Besides the above, I am proficient in various languages such as Javascript, Java, Python, C, Kotlin and Swift. I have experience with many aspects that pertain to web and mobile development. Find out more about me on my portfolio website!
